# Laaflet.js library application

### This is a work in progress and I will be continuing to push changes as I continue to develop the functionality.

## Project Description

This is a web application that displays a map of the world and allows users to select a country from a dropdown menu to view information about that country. The app will displays the selected country's name, capital city, population, and area in square kilometers, as well as additional information. It also highlights the country's borders on the map. The information will pop up in a modal box and will also allow the user to choose between different map styles, for example dark mode.

## Technologies used 

The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses the Leaflet.js library for the map display and the jQuery library for handling user input. The project also includes a PHP script that retrieves data about countries from a GeoJSON file.
